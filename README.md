Blog-for-Google-App-Engine
==========================

This is a simple blog created with Python to run on Google App Engine.

This blog was inspired from the CS253 course I took on Udacity.com. The blog has been greatly improved to
include optimized, efficient and practical code. I mainly created it as a learning experience for
web development.

This blog uses the following:

- Google App Engine
- Python 2.7
- HTML5 Boilerplate v4.0.0 (via the initializer.com)
- Titter Bootstrap v2.1.1 (via the initializer.com)
- Modernizer v2.6.1 (via the initializer.com)
- jQuery v1.8.1 (via the initializer.com)
- jinja2 templates (via Google App Engine)
